# Accomplishments & Reflections

### Week 1 
* 2/10/23  
  * Researched ideas for an SQL database project.   
  * Decided on a book database based on Goodreads so that I can implement custom search filters.  
  * Created README in word  
  * Created Design Doc in word  


* 2/11/23
  * Created an accomplishment tracking   
  * Installed plugin to create builder pattern  
  * Created Book entity  
  * Created BookRepository  
  * Created BookService with basic CRUD operations (Still need to work on custom filtering)  
  * Created BookController  
  * Working on configuration for Postgres and Docker. It currently runs into an error related to 'authors' in the table.  

2/12/23
* The JSON format for Book has 2 lists of objects; popular_shelves and authors. 
  I incorrectly coded the attributes as List<List<>> instead of List\<Object>. 
  I updated and created classes, however I am still getting JPA/Hibernate errors for mapping these columns. 
  I am researching JPA fields and annotations.  
  * If a persistent field is a Collection type, it must include the annotation *@ElementCollection*
  * List\<Role> and List\<Shelf> are embedded classes:
    * Embeddable classes are used to represent the state of an entity but donâ€™t have a persistent identity of their own.  
    * @Embeddable annotation is used above the class declaration.
    * @Embedded can be used in the @Entity class but is not required.
  

  * Now I'm getting error org.hibernate.exception.GenericJDBCException: Unable to open JDBC Connection for DDL execution
    * My docker configuration previously ran with template variables and saved it to the data/pg folder.
      I corrected the variables, deleted the pg data, and re-ran docker setup to fix the issue.  


### Week 2
* 2/13/23  
  Researched JSON objects and libraries.
    
  * Gson is easy to use, standardized, efficient, optimized, and does not require libraries apart from JDK.
  * Added the Gson dependency in the gradle build.
  * Successfully deserialized a JSON string to a Book object


* 2/14/23  
  Imports stopped working in this project.
    ![](images/import-errors-image.png)
  * I spent hours trying to figure this out with no solution. It seems to be related to either an IDE(IntelliJ) or Gradle issue.
    * Older projects were unaffected.
    * I tried invalidating caches and restarting IntelliJ
    * I tried deleting the .idea and build directories to rebuild the project.
    * Another recommendation was to uninstall/reinstall IntelliJ. (Did not do this since other projects were unaffected.)
  * After starting a new Gradle project with Spring Initializr and copying the packages/files, the imports are working agian.


* 2/15/23  
  * Seeding the Book database:
    * Initial issue is the zipped file is a list of JSON strings separated by lines. So, I need to figure out how to iterate the file by line, convert to a Book object, and save to the DB.  
      * I first tried to unzip the file and use a buffered reader which resulted in a very large file.
      * After referencing the Goodreads dataset project documentation, I found a function in Python on how to load the data.  
        * https://github.com/MengtingWan/goodreads/blob/master/samples.ipynb
        * Used this as the basis to create my BookSeeder class.

    * Issue with the primary key/id:
      * Failed to execute CommandLineRunner...Unknown integral data type for ids : java.lang.String;
      * ISBNs are unique numeric identifiers, so I thought I could use them as the primary key. 
        The issue is they are all strings in the JSON data set. Hibernate does not like this since it is a String.
        * Should I convert these to Integers or use a generated UUID as the primary key?
        * ISBN is a numeric identifier assigned by publishers. -> I do not want to auto-generate these.
        * For purposes of this project (return a recommendations list of filtered results), there is no need to lookup a book by a single ISBN or key.
      * Solution is to modify code base to use UUID as a primary key and make ISBN a normal field/column. 

    * Application now runs with error Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: value too long for type character varying(255)
      * bookDescription is too long for default varchar 255. Updated the @Column(length = 10000);

* 2/16/23
  * BookSeeder runs but does not populate all columns. Some have null data.
    * ???

## TODO
* Create architecture diagram 
* Figure out how to seed the database from the JSON files  
* create the data model classes for book, author, and genres  
* create the JPA repos  
* create the service  
* create the controllers with working endpoints  
* Improve scalability:
  * Implement logging to document performance before and after
  * Implement pagination
  * Implement caching
